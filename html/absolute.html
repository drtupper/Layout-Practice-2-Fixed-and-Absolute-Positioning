    <h1>Absolute Position</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 1.2;">An element with <strong>position: absolute;</strong> is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).  However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. The <strong>top</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>bottom</strong>, and <strong>left</strong> properties are used to position the element.</p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.2;">Setting position to absolute removes an element from the flow, and it is ignored by the elements around it.</p>
    <p>1.  This page is formatted the same as the fixed page except the position of the h1 header is set to <strong>position: absolute;</strong>.  Scroll the page and note the difference in behavior for the h1 header.</p>
    <p>2.  Now toggle the <strong>position: absolute; </strong> line for the <strong>.small-box </strong> in the <strong>absolute.css</strong> file and refresh the page.  What happens to the box?</p>
    <p>3.  Scroll the page.  Did anything change after adding <strong>position: absolute;</strong> to the small box?</p>
    <p>4. Change the positioning for the small box to <strong>position: fixed;</strong>,  Refresh the page and note what changes.</p>
    <p>5.  Scroll the page and note what is different now.</p>
    <div class="big-box"><div class="small-box"></div></div>
