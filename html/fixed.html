    <h1>Fixed Position</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 1.2;">An element with <strong>position: fixed;</strong> is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The <strong>top</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>bottom</strong>, and <strong>left</strong> properties are used to position the element.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.2;">A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>
    <p>1.  Scroll the page and watch what happens.  Does everything move?</p>
    <p>2.  In the <strong>fixed.css</strong> page, toggle the <strong>position: fixed;</strong> line and refresh this page.  What happens to the h1 header?</p>
    <p>3.  With the position of the h1 header fixed, scroll the page.  Is the behavior different than with flow layout?</p>
    <p>4.  Put the h1 header at the very top of the page by adding <strong>top: 0;</strong> below the <strong>position: fixed;</strong> in the <strong>fixed.css</strong> file for the h1 header.</p>
    <p>5.  The h1 header now overlaps the hyperlink and the first paragraph.  Use relative positioning in <strong>fixed.css</strong> file to push the hyperlink and the paragraph down by 56 px.</p>
    <p>6. Scroll the page. 
 What happens when the paragraph text hits the h1 header?</p>
    <p>7.  Now let's stretch the header across the page.  Add <strong>right: 0px;</strong> and <strong>left: 0px;</strong> below <strong>top: 0px;</strong> in the fixed .css file  </p>
    <p>8.  Now scroll the page.  What happens?</p>
    <p>9.  Let's make the header move to the front of the stack by adding <strong>z-index: 1;</strong> to the h1 selector in the <strong>fixed.css </strong> file.</p>
    <p>10. Scroll the page.  What has changed?</p>
